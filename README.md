## Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project
Employers really care about how well can you apply your knowledge and skills to solve real world problems. Now that you've taken several courses on Data Science and Machine Learning, its time to put your learning to practice and work on a data problem involving a real life scenario.

New Yorkers use 311 system to report complaints for the non-emergency problems they face. Various agencies in New York get assigned to these problems. The data related to these Complaints are available in New York City Open Dataset. On investigation one can see that in last few years the 311 complaints coming to The Department of Housing Preservation and Development in New York City has increased significantly.

In this Capstone project your task would be to find out answers to some questions that would help The Department of Housing Preservation and Development in New York City to effectively tackle 311 complaints coming to them. You need to use Python and Data Science and Machine Learning techniques such as Data Ingestion, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, Probabilistic Modeling, Model Validation, etc.

By the end of this course you will have used real world Data Science tools to create a showcase project and demostrate to employers that you are job ready and a worthy candidate in the field of Data Science.
